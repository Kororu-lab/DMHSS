# DMHSS
Discreet Mental Health Support System (DMHSS)

Our Primary Goal is to construct integrated model to perform spot out people in danger of suicide. For the goal the models analyze full reddit archive data from https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1479c7b/historic_reddit_archives_ongoing_archival_effort/?rdt=43321, especially focusing on r/SuicideWatch user activity and some mental health related subreddits. 

## Previous Studies
Our project based on previous sentiment-based suicidal-detct models from Kaggle project "Suicide and Depression Detection"(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhileswarkomati/suicide-watch). It gave dataset of two subreddit "r/SuicideWatch", "r/depression" submission data and labeled them as T/F of suicidal danger. With this dataset and idea we first tried to upgrade the performance the model but found that these kind of approach has limit in their essens,as below:
### Problem I: Lack of Theoritical Basis of Classification.
The Kaggle project, to classify reddit user by their subreddit only, could make error since those submission data could not generalize full users who in danger of suicide. In r/SuicideWatch could be some people not in danger, while r/depression could contain some people who are in severe condition. It could only find out if the post from SW or outer, not the user danger of suicidal.
### Problem II: Lack of External Information or Metadata
This kind of method, to classify T/F by submission text only, could not get full features of people who trying to end his life. For mor
